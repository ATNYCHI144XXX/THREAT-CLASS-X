## Megalithic Structures

### 1. Great Pyramid of Giza, Egypt
**Coordinates**: 29.9792°N, 31.1342°E
**Age**: ~2580-2560 BCE (4,600 years)

**Specifications**:
- Original height: 146.5 m (230.4 m base)
- Blocks: ~2.3 million, average 2.5 tonnes
- Largest blocks: 80 tonnes (King's Chamber)
- Alignment: 3 arcminutes from true north

**Mathematical Relationships**:
$$\tan(51°52') = \frac{h}{b/2} = \frac{4}{\pi} \approx 1.273$$

- Slope angle 51°52' approximates 4/π ratio
- Perimeter/height ratio ≈ 2π
- Built-in cubit: 0.5236 m (≈ π/6 meters)

**Note**: Whether these π relationships are intentional encoding or coincidental remains debated. Ancient measurement precision (±several arcminutes) should be considered when evaluating mathematical claims.

**Anomalies**:
- Precision of alignment (pre-compass)
- Weight-moving techniques (ramp theories vs unknown methods)
- Internal chamber acoustics (resonant frequency 16 Hz)

**Threat Level**: None (static monument)
**Research Interest**: HIGH (construction methods still debated)
